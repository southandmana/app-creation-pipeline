## Universal Psychological Principles Used by Big Tech

### **Cross-Company Consensus Patterns:**
All major tech companies apply these psychological foundations:
- **Behavioral Economics Integration:** Apply psychological biases to influence decisions
- **Variable Reward Systems:** Use intermittent reinforcement for engagement
- **Social Proof Mechanisms:** Leverage peer behavior and social validation
- **Loss Aversion Tactics:** Focus on preventing losses rather than promoting gains
- **Cognitive Load Reduction:** Simplify decisions to increase completion rates
- **Habit Formation Design:** Create automatic behavioral loops

## Behavioral Economics in Product Design

### **Core Principles Applied:**

**1. Mental Models & Heuristics**
- Users rely on mental shortcuts rather than rational decision-making
- Design products that align with existing mental models
- Use familiar patterns to reduce cognitive load

**2. Bias Exploitation**
- **Default Bias:** Users stick with preset options
- **Anchoring Bias:** First presented information influences decisions
- **Confirmation Bias:** Users seek information confirming existing beliefs
- **Scarcity Principle:** Limited availability increases perceived value

**3. Framing Effects**
- Present information in ways that influence perception
- Use positive vs. negative framing strategically
- Apply social proof to normalize desired behaviors

## Persuasive Technology Framework

### **B.J. Fogg's Stanford Model (Used Industry-Wide):**

**Fogg Behavior Model (FBM):**
```
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Trigger

Where:
- Motivation: User's desire to perform behavior
- Ability: User's capacity to perform behavior  
- Trigger: Prompt that initiates behavior
```

**Three Categories of Persuasive Technology:**
1. **Tool:** Helps people be more efficient at target behavior
2. **Medium:** Provides experience that leads to persuasion
3. **Social Actor:** Creates relationship that leads to persuasion

### **Implementation Strategies:**

**Variable Reward Scheduling:**
- Random reinforcement creates strongest engagement
- Examples: Social media likes, game rewards, notification patterns
- Based on Skinner's operant conditioning research

**Hook Model (Nir Eyal):**
```
1. Trigger → 2. Action → 3. Variable Reward → 4. Investment
```

**Habit Formation Loop:**
- Cue (trigger) → Routine (action) → Reward (benefit) → Investment (increasing commitment)
