# Multi-Phase Research System

A simple methodology for conducting thorough research using varied search queries and consensus analysis.

## Core Methodology

### **4-Phase Research Strategy**
Instead of repeating identical searches, use different queries across 4 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Landscape Discovery** - What exists in this space?
2. **Phase 2: Specific Examples** - How do the best practitioners do it?
3. **Phase 3: Standards & Frameworks** - What are the established rules?
4. **Phase 4: Current Trends** - What's the current state of the art?

### **Query Variation Principle**
- Use 3-5 different search queries per research topic
- Each query targets a different angle or perspective
- Avoid repetition - vary keywords, sources, and focus
- Look for consensus patterns across different searches

### **Consensus Analysis**
1. **Collect** - Gather results from all search phases
2. **Compare** - Identify information that appears across multiple searches
3. **Validate** - Consistent information across sources = higher reliability
4. **Synthesize** - Create conclusions based on repeated patterns

## Simple Implementation

1. **Define Research Question** - Write a clear, specific question
2. **Create 4 Search Queries** - One for each phase above
3. **Execute Searches** - Run each query and save results
4. **Find Consensus** - Look for information that appears in multiple searches
5. **Base Conclusions** - Use repeated findings, not single-source information

## Quality Check

**Good Research:**
- Multiple sources confirm key points
- Clear patterns emerge across searches
- Actionable recommendations result

**Poor Research:**
- Information only appears once
- No clear patterns or consensus
- Contradictory information across searches

This approach ensures reliable research for any topic without over-complication.
