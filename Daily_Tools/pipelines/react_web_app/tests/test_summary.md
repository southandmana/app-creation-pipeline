# Test Summary: React Web App Pipeline

## Overview
This folder contains test sessions for the react_web_app pipeline, tracking errors, fixes, and improvements over time.

## Test Sessions

| Session | Date | Duration | Errors Found | Status | Key Findings |
|---------|------|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Test_001 | [Pending] | - | - | Not Started | Initial baseline test needed |

## Pipeline Health Trends
- **Current Status:** Not yet tested with error capture system
- **Target:** 85%+ feature completeness, professional code quality
- **Complexity:** Supports any React app type with universal flexibility

## Historical Patterns
*No test data available yet - first test session needed*

## Recommendations for Next Test
1. Test universal app type support (try different categories)
2. Validate 11-step sequential execution workflow
3. Check system detection and technology optimization
4. Test comprehensive error handling throughout pipeline
