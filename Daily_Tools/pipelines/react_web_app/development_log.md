# React Pipeline Development Log

## Purpose
This document captures the real-time process of building the React Web App pipeline specifically. Every decision, test result, and bug fix for React app generation is logged here.

---

## Day 1: Initial Setup and Planning

### Decision 1: Starting with React Web Apps
**Time:** [Session Start]
**Why React first?**
- 75% automation possibility (based on research)
- Most mature AI code generation support
- Large ecosystem with abundant templates
- Can progressively add complexity

### Decision 2: Documentation-First Approach
**What:** Creating this log WHILE building, not after
**Why:** 
- Captures reasoning in the moment
- Won't forget important details
- Creates reusable process for next pipelines

### Decision 3: Project Structure
**Initial structure created:**
```
app_creator_1/
├── pipeline_creation_log.md (this file)
├── pipelines/
│   └── react_web_app/
│       ├── templates/
│       ├── prompts/
│       └── examples/
└── lessons_learned.md (to be created)
```

**Why this structure?**
- Keeps everything in the main project (not scattered across desktop)
- `templates/` - Reusable code structures
- `prompts/` - Tested prompts that generate good code
- `examples/` - Sample apps to validate pipeline

## Building the React Pipeline

### Step 1: Define Pipeline Phases
**Timestamp:** [Current Session]

The React app pipeline will have these phases:

1. **Initialization Phase**
   - User provides app idea
   - System asks clarifying questions
   - Generate app specification

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Break down into components
   - Define data structures
   - Plan file architecture

3. **Generation Phase**
   - Create project structure
   - Generate components
   - Set up routing
   - Implement business logic

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Run tests
   - Check for errors
   - Ensure app runs

### Step 2: Create the Trigger System
[To be documented as we build it]

### Current Questions to Resolve:
1. How should the markdown trigger files work?
2. What format for storing app specifications?
3. How to handle iterative improvements?
4. How to manage context limits with large apps?

## Time Tracking

| Task | Estimated Time | Actual Time | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Initial setup | 30 min | [In Progress] | Includes folder structure and documentation |
| Pipeline design | - | - | Not started |
| Template creation | - | - | Not started |
| Testing | - | - | Not started |

---

## Key Insights (Updated as we go)

1. **Keeping pipeline files in main project is better** - Everything stays together, easier to manage

2. [More insights will be added as we progress]

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Define the exact markdown trigger format
- [ ] Create first template for React app
- [ ] Build the question-asking system
- [ ] Test with a simple todo app

## Notes for Future Pipelines
Based on this experience, when creating the next pipeline (e.g., CLI tools), remember to:
