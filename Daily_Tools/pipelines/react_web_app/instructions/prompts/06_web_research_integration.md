  queries.push(...generateCategoryQueries(appCategory))
  
  // Requirement-specific queries
  queries.push(...generateRequirementQueries(userRequirements))
  
  // Capability-specific queries
  queries.push(...generateCapabilityQueries(detectedCapabilities))

  return queries

  const baseQueries = [
    `React dependencies ${tier} systems 2025`,
    `React performance optimization ${tier} memory`,
    `React build configuration ${tier} systems`
  ]
  
  return baseQueries

## Research Integration Points in Flow

### Integration Point 1: Post-System Detection
**Location:** Between Step 4 (System Detection) and Step 5 (Questions)

```markdown
**User sees:**
```
‚úÖ System Check Complete!
üîç Researching latest tools optimized for your system...

Your Setup:
‚Ä¢ Node.js: v18.17.0 (Excellent - supports latest libraries!)
‚Ä¢ RAM: 16GB (High-end - can use premium dependencies)

üìä Research findings: Based on current benchmarks, I can use the most 
advanced React libraries for optimal performance on your system.

Now let me ask a few questions to make sure I create exactly what you want...
```

**AI does simultaneously:**
- Researches system-optimized libraries
- Validates compatibility with detected capabilities  
- Identifies performance opportunities

### Integration Point 2: Pre-Specification Research
**Location:** After questions completed, before specification generation

```markdown
**User sees:**
```
üìã All questions answered! 

üîç Researching the best technologies for your [GAME] app...
‚Ä¢ Checking latest React gaming libraries...
‚Ä¢ Validating performance optimizations...  
‚Ä¢ Reviewing security best practices...
‚Ä¢ Confirming compatibility...

This ensures I use the most current and effective tools for your project.
```

**AI researches:**
- Latest libraries for the specific app category
- Current best practices for identified features
- Security updates and recommendations
- Performance optimization techniques

### Integration Point 3: Pre-Build Validation
**Location:** After user confirms specification, before code generation

```markdown
**User sees:**
```
Perfect! I've prepared the complete build plan.

üîç Final check: Verifying latest versions and security updates...
‚úÖ All dependencies verified secure and up-to-date
‚úÖ Build configuration optimized for your system
‚úÖ Following 2025 React best practices

Starting development now...
```

**AI validates:**

## Research Quality Assurance

### Research Source Prioritization:
1. **Official documentation** (React, library maintainers)
2. **Established tech publications** (DEV, Medium engineering blogs)
3. **GitHub repositories** (recent activity, star count, maintenance)
4. **Stack Overflow** (recent answers, high-voted solutions)
5. **Performance benchmarks** (independent testing, real-world usage)

### Research Validation Criteria:
- **Recency:** Prioritize information from last 6-12 months
- **Source credibility:** Official sources > community consensus
- **Performance data:** Benchmark results > theoretical claims
- **Security status:** Active maintenance > feature richness
- **Community adoption:** Wide usage > cutting-edge features

### Research Result Confidence Levels:
- **High confidence:** Multiple reliable sources agree
- **Medium confidence:** Some conflicting information, but clear trend
- **Low confidence:** Limited or conflicting data, use conservative defaults

---

## Documentation Integration (Step 7)

**MANDATORY**: Create research findings documentation:

```bash
# Copy and initialize research findings template
cp instructions/templates/documentation/03_research_findings_template.md \
   generated_apps/[app-name]/_agent_session/03_research_findings.md
```

**Fill in the template with:**
- Complete 4-phase research results (Landscape ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Standards ‚Üí Trends)
- Technology selection rationale based on research evidence
- Security and performance considerations researched
- Consensus analysis across multiple sources
- Final technology stack decisions with justification
- Research confidence levels for each decision

This creates a professional audit trail of how technology choices were made based on current best practices and research evidence.
