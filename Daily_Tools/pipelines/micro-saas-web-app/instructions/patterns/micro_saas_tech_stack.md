## Default Micro SaaS Stack (Proven Profitable)

### Core Stack (Always Use)
Based on research consensus from successful $10K-50K/month micro SaaS tools:

```javascript
const MICRO_SAAS_STACK = {
  frontend: "NextJS 14+", 
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  backend: "NextJS API Routes + Vercel Functions",
  database: "Supabase PostgreSQL",
  authentication: "Supabase Auth",
  payments: "Stripe",
  deployment: "Vercel",
  analytics: "Vercel Analytics + Posthog",
  monitoring: "Vercel Monitoring"
}
```

### Why This Stack Wins:
- **2-7 day build time** (research validated)
- **$0-50/month operating costs** until profitable
- **Automatic scaling** with zero DevOps
- **Proven by $1M+ ARR micro SaaS** examples
- **Built-in revenue optimization** tools

## Component Library Selection

### High-End Systems (16GB+ RAM, Modern CPU):
```javascript
const HIGH_END_COMPONENTS = {
  uiLibrary: "shadcn/ui", // Perfect for micro SaaS, professional look
  stateManagement: "Zustand", // Lightweight, perfect for micro SaaS
  forms: "React Hook Form + Zod", // Best UX for signup/payment forms
  animations: "Framer Motion", // Premium feel justifies higher prices
  icons: "Lucide React", // Professional icon set
  charts: "Recharts", // For analytics dashboards
  payments: "Stripe Elements", // Industry standard
}
```

### Mid-Range Systems (8-16GB RAM):
```javascript
const MID_RANGE_COMPONENTS = {
  uiLibrary: "Chakra UI", // Fast development, good enough
  stateManagement: "useState + Context", // Built-in, no dependencies
  forms: "React Hook Form", // Essential for good UX
  animations: "CSS transitions", // Lightweight but professional
  icons: "React Icons", // Large selection, reasonable size

  payments: "Stripe Checkout", // Hosted solution, easier
}
```

### Budget Systems (<8GB RAM):
```javascript
const BUDGET_COMPONENTS = {
  uiLibrary: "Custom Tailwind", // Maximum control, minimum bundle
  stateManagement: "useState", // Simplest approach
  forms: "Basic forms + validation", // Custom validation
  animations: "CSS only", // No JS overhead
  icons: "Heroicons", // Small, curated set
  charts: "Simple CSS charts", // Creative but lightweight
  payments: "Stripe Payment Links", // Zero integration complexity
}
```

## Cost Structure

### Startup Costs (First 3 months):
```
Vercel Pro: $20/month (hobby free until needed)
Supabase Pro: $25/month (free tier first)
Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
Domain: $12/year
Total: ~$50/month until profitable
```

### Scale Economics:
- **$0-1K MRR**: Stay on free tiers (~$15/month total)
- **$1K-10K MRR**: Upgrade to paid tiers (~$100/month total)  
- **$10K+ MRR**: Enterprise features as needed

### Profitability Math:
- Break-even at ~$150/month revenue (3% overhead)
- 97%+ profit margin after breaking even
- Scales automatically with zero DevOps overhead
