# Step 2: System Detection & Technology Optimization

## Purpose
Perform comprehensive system detection and intelligent technology selection in a single integrated step. Detect development environment capabilities, analyze hardware specifications, and research optimal technologies for the chosen micro SaaS type, ensuring maximum performance and profitability.

---

## Dual-Purpose Detection Process

### Phase 1: Development Environment Detection

**Mandatory System Commands:**
```bash
# Core development tools
node --version
npm --version
git --version

# Network connectivity (for package installation)
ping -c 1 google.com

# Alternative package managers (if available)
yarn --version 2>/dev/null || echo "Yarn not installed"
pnpm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "PNPM not installed"
```

**Environment Assessment:**
- **Node.js Version**: Determine latest feature compatibility
- **Package Manager**: Identify optimal installation method
- **Git Availability**: Confirm version control capabilities
- **Network Access**: Validate package download capability

---

### Phase 2: Hardware Specification Detection

**Memory Detection Commands:**
```bash
# macOS memory detection
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Memory:" | head -1

# Linux memory detection  
free -h | grep "Mem:" | awk '{print "Memory: " $2}'

# Windows memory (if applicable)
wmic OS get TotalVisibleMemorySize /value | grep "TotalVisibleMemorySize"
```

**CPU and System Information:**
```bash
# Operating system identification
uname -a

# macOS CPU detection
sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string 2>/dev/null

# Linux CPU detection
lscpu | grep "Model name" | head -1 2>/dev/null

# CPU core count
nproc 2>/dev/null || sysctl -n hw.ncpu 2>/dev/null || echo "CPU cores: Unknown"
```

**Storage Analysis:**
```bash
# Available disk space
df -h . | tail -1 | awk '{print "Available storage: " $4}'

# Home directory space (for development)
df -h ~ | tail -1 | awk '{print "Home directory space: " $4}'
```

---

### Phase 3: System Tier Classification

**Classification Logic:**
```javascript
const classifySystemTier = (systemSpecs) => {
  const { nodeVersion, memory, cpu, storage } = systemSpecs
  
  // Extract version numbers and specs
  const nodeVersionNumber = parseFloat(nodeVersion.replace('v', ''))
  const memoryGB = parseMemoryToGB(memory)
  const isModernCPU = detectModernCPU(cpu)
  
  if (nodeVersionNumber >= 18 && memoryGB >= 16 && isModernCPU) {
    return {
      tier: 'high-end',
      capabilities: 'Premium libraries and advanced features supported',
      optimizations: 'Full feature micro SaaS stack with performance libraries'
    }
  } else if (nodeVersionNumber >= 16 && memoryGB >= 8) {
    return {
      tier: 'mid-range', 
      capabilities: 'Balanced approach with moderate resource usage',
      optimizations: 'Optimized micro SaaS stack with essential features'
    }
  } else {
    return {
      tier: 'budget',
      capabilities: 'Lightweight alternatives and conservative resource usage',
      optimizations: 'Minimal micro SaaS stack focused on core functionality'
    }
  }
}
```

**System Tier Definitions:**

**High-End Systems:**
- Node.js 18+
- 16GB+ RAM
- Modern CPU (M1/M2/M3, Intel i7+, AMD Ryzen 7+)
- Sufficient storage (>50GB available)

**Mid-Range Systems:**
- Node.js 16+
- 8-16GB RAM  
- Decent CPU (Intel i5, AMD Ryzen 5, older high-end)
- Moderate storage (>20GB available)

**Budget Systems:**
- Node.js 14+
- 4-8GB RAM
- Basic CPU (older generations, budget processors)
- Limited storage (>10GB available)

  frontend: "NextJS 14+",
  backend: "NextJS API Routes", 
  database: "Supabase PostgreSQL",
  authentication: "Supabase Auth",
  payments: "Stripe",
  deployment: "Vercel"
}
```

**System-Optimized Enhancements:**

**High-End System Enhancements:**
```javascript
const HIGH_END_ENHANCEMENTS = {
  stateManagement: "Zustand", // Lightweight but powerful

    `best ${microSaasType} technology stack 2025`,
    `${microSaasType} NextJS Stripe Supabase performance`,
    `profitable ${microSaasType} tech stack ROI`
  ]
  
  const systemQueries = [
    `${microSaasType} libraries ${systemTier} system optimization`,
    `React performance ${microSaasType} ${systemTier} memory`,
    `${microSaasType} build optimization ${systemTier} setup`
  ]
  
  return [...baseQueries, ...systemQueries]
}
```

**Technology Validation Criteria:**
1. **Performance**: Will it perform well on detected system?
