# Test Summary: Micro SaaS Web App Pipeline

## Overview
This folder contains test sessions for the micro-saas-web-app pipeline, tracking errors, fixes, and improvements over time.

## Test Sessions

| Session | Date | Duration | Errors Found | Status | Key Findings |
|---------|------|----------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| Test_001 | [Pending] | - | - | Not Started | Initial baseline test needed |

## Pipeline Health Trends
- **Current Status:** Not yet tested with error capture system
- **Known Issues:** Template inconsistencies, Step 6 scope too large, incomplete curated links
- **Improvement Priority:** Fix critical UX issues before production

## Historical Patterns
*No test data available yet - first test session needed*

## Recommendations for Next Test
1. Focus on full pipeline execution to capture complete error set
2. Test Step 5-6 loop particularly (known critical area)
3. Validate template consistency issues
4. Check all file accessibility after containment strategy
