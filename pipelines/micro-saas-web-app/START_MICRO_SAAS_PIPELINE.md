## üö® COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY

### **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR 100% COMPLIANCE:**

1. **State Tracking**: EVERY step must be tracked in TodoWrite before/during/after execution
2. **Sequential Execution**: Steps 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4‚Üí5‚ü∑6‚Üí7‚Üí8‚Üí9‚Üí10‚Üí11 (no skipping allowed)
3. **Instruction File Reading**: Each step requires reading its designated instruction file
4. **Template Compliance**: Use exact templates - no variations allowed
5. **Validation Gates**: Complete ALL checklist items before proceeding to next step

### **MOST CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT ZONES:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **STEP 5-6 LOOP**: The business question/market validation loop is THE MOST CRITICAL part
- Step 5: ONE business question at a time with progress indicators
- Step 6: MANDATORY market validation after each question (90% threshold)
- Loop until viable business model or max 4 rounds

‚ö†Ô∏è **BUSINESS FOCUS**: Every decision must prioritize revenue generation and profitability

‚ö†Ô∏è **TECHNOLOGY STACK**: Must use proven micro SaaS stack (NextJS + Stripe + Supabase)

### **VIOLATION DETECTION TRIGGERS:**

üõë If you find yourself:
- Asking multiple business questions at once ‚Üí STOP, return to Step 5 protocol
- Skipping Step 6 market validation ‚Üí STOP, run validation immediately  
- Not using TodoWrite ‚Üí STOP, update state tracking
- Deviating from micro SaaS stack ‚Üí STOP, use specified technology stack
- Ignoring revenue/business focus ‚Üí STOP, refocus on profitability
