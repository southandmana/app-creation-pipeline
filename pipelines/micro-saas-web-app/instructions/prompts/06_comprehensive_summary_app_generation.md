### Phase 2: Complete Application Generation

**Code Generation Execution:**

**Step 1: Project Infrastructure Setup**
```bash
# System-optimized NextJS project creation
npx create-next-app@latest [strategic-app-name] --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app

# Navigate and install dependencies
cd [strategic-app-name]

# Install micro SaaS dependencies based on Step 2 system optimization
npm install @supabase/supabase-js @stripe/stripe-js stripe
npm install @supabase/auth-ui-react @supabase/auth-ui-shared
npm install lucide-react clsx tailwind-merge

# System-specific additional dependencies
[High-End Systems: npm install framer-motion @radix-ui/react-*]
[Mid-Range Systems: npm install @headlessui/react]
[Budget Systems: Custom Tailwind components only]
```

**Step 2: Strategic Business Infrastructure**

**Database Schema Generation (Supabase):**
```sql
-- User profiles with subscription management
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT,
  full_name TEXT,
  subscription_status TEXT DEFAULT 'free',
  subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'starter',
  stripe_customer_id TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- [Micro SaaS specific tables based on Step 1 selection]
-- Generated based on chosen micro SaaS type and core features
[Productivity Tool: Projects, Tasks, Teams tables]
[Analytics Tool: Data sources, Reports, Dashboards tables]
[Business Management: Customers, Invoices, Transactions tables]
[Development Tool: Repositories, Deployments, Monitoring tables]

-- Usage tracking for network effects and analytics
CREATE TABLE usage_analytics (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  feature_used TEXT NOT NULL,
  usage_data JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- Competitive moats implementation through data
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  preferences JSONB NOT NULL,
  customizations JSONB,
  integrations JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- Row Level Security Implementation
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE [micro_saas_tables] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE usage_analytics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_preferences ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for security moats
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);
[Additional policies for all tables...]
```

    // Comparative analytics unavailable to competitors with less data
    // Industry insights that require significant user base
    // Predictive features that get better with more users
  }
  
  // Platform lock-in through data dependencies
  createCustomerDependencies(userPreferences: any) {
    // Complex custom configurations hard to recreate
    // Integrated workflows that become essential
    // Historical data that's valuable and hard to export
  }
}
```

**Step 6: Revenue Optimization Features**
