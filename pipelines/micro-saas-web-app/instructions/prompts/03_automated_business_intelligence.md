## Research Processing & Analysis

### Data Synthesis Process:

**Step 1: Collect Raw Research Data**
- Execute all research queries using WebSearch tool

- Prioritize recent data (last 12-18 months)
- Focus on quantified results over anecdotal evidence

**Step 2: Analyze and Validate Findings**
```javascript
const analyzeBusinessIntelligence = (researchResults) => {
  return {
    targetMarket: {
      primarySegment: extractOptimalCustomerSegment(researchResults),
      marketSize: calculateTotalAddressableMarket(researchResults),
      willingnessToPay: analyzePriceAcceptance(researchResults),
      acquisitionChannels: identifyEffectiveChannels(researchResults)
    },
    pricingStrategy: {
      optimalPrice: determineOptimalPricing(researchResults),
      pricingModel: selectOptimalModel(researchResults),
      competitivePosition: analyzePricingVsCompetitors(researchResults),
      premiumJustification: identifyPremiumFactors(researchResults)
    },
    valueProposition: {
      primaryValue: extractStrongestValue(researchResults),
      quantifiedBenefits: identifyMeasurableBenefits(researchResults),
      customerLanguage: extractCustomerVoice(researchResults),
      competitiveAdvantage: identifyUniqueValue(researchResults)
    },
    featureStrategy: {
      coreFeatures: identifyEssentialFeatures(researchResults),
      revenueDrivers: identifyRevenueFeatures(researchResults),
      retentionFeatures: identifyRetentionFeatures(researchResults),

      competitiveRisks: identifyRisks(researchResults),
      scalabilityFactors: assessScalability(researchResults)
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Confidence Assessment**
- **High Confidence**: Multiple sources agree, quantified data available
- **Medium Confidence**: Some consensus, limited quantified data
- **Low Confidence**: Conflicting data, use conservative estimates
