## Differentiation Strategy Development

### Gap Identification Process:

**Step 1: Competitive Mapping**
```javascript
const createCompetitiveMap = (competitors) => {
  return competitors.map(competitor => ({
    name: competitor.name,
    strengths: extractStrengths(competitor),
    weaknesses: extractWeaknesses(competitor),
    pricing: competitor.pricing,
    features: competitor.features,
    userFeedback: competitor.reviews,
    positioning: competitor.messaging
  }))
}
```

**Step 2: Opportunity Identification**
```javascript
const identifyOpportunities = (competitiveMap, marketResearch) => {
  return {
    userExperienceGaps: findUXOpportunities(competitiveMap),
    featureGaps: findMissingFeatures(competitiveMap, marketResearch),
    positioningGaps: findMessagingOpportunities(competitiveMap),
    pricingGaps: findPricingOpportunities(competitiveMap),
    serviceGaps: findServiceOpportunities(competitiveMap)
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Differentiation Strategy Selection**
```javascript
const selectDifferentiationStrategy = (opportunities, businessIntelligence) => {
  // Prioritize opportunities based on:
  // 1. Market demand strength
  // 2. Implementation feasibility 
  // 3. Competitive defensibility
  // 4. Revenue impact potential
  
  return {
    primaryDifferentiator: selectTopOpportunity(opportunities),
    supportingDifferentiators: selectSecondaryOpportunities(opportunities),
    positioningStrategy: developPositioning(opportunities, businessIntelligence),
    visualIdentity: designDifferentiation(opportunities)
  }
}
```
