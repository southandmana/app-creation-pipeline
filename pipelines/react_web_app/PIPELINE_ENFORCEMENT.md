# PIPELINE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM

## üõë CRITICAL COMPLIANCE PROTOCOL

This file contains the **MANDATORY EXECUTION TRACKER** that guarantees 100% pipeline compliance.

## üìã PIPELINE STATE MACHINE

### **CURRENT STATE**: READY_TO_START
### **NEXT REQUIRED ACTION**: Execute Step 1 validation gate

| Step 3 | ‚è≥ PENDING | Read `03_detailed_description.md`, Use exact response template | ‚ùå |
| Step 4 | ‚è≥ PENDING | System detection, Classify system tier | ‚ùå |
| Step 5 | ‚è≥ PENDING | Read `05_question_engine.md`, ONE question at a time | ‚ùå |
| Step 6 | ‚è≥ PENDING | Read `07_completeness_evaluation.md`, 85% evaluation | ‚ùå |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION PREVENTION SYSTEM

### **AUTOMATIC VIOLATION DETECTION:**

üõë **If you detect yourself:**
1. **Asking multiple questions**: IMMEDIATELY stop and return to Step 5 single-question protocol
2. **Skipping Step 6 evaluation**: IMMEDIATELY stop and run completeness evaluation
3. **Not updating TodoWrite**: IMMEDIATELY stop and update state tracking
4. **Using modified templates**: IMMEDIATELY stop and use exact template specified
5. **Combining steps**: IMMEDIATELY stop and execute steps individually

### **RECOVERY PROTOCOL:**
1. Identify which step was violated
2. Return to that step's validation gate
3. Complete ALL checklist items for that step
4. Update this enforcement tracker
5. Proceed sequentially from that point

---

## üìä COMPLIANCE GUARANTEE SYSTEM

### **STATE VALIDATION RULES:**
- Cannot proceed to Step N+1 without completing Step N validation gate
- Cannot skip the Step 5-6 evaluation loop
- Cannot proceed to Step 7 without 85% completeness OR max 4 question rounds
- Must read designated instruction file before executing each step
- Must use exact templates without modifications
- Must update TodoWrite at each major checkpoint

### **ENFORCEMENT STRENGTH**: 
**MAXIMUM** - This system makes deviation nearly impossible through systematic checkpoints and validation gates.

## üéØ USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Before starting**: Read this entire file
2. **During execution**: Check validation gates at each step
3. **After each step**: Update the step completion tracker above
4. **If stuck**: Review violation prevention system
5. **If confused**: Return to the specific instruction file for that step

**This system guarantees 100% pipeline compliance when followed systematically.**
