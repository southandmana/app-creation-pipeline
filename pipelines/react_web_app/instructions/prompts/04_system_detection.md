# Step 4: System Detection with Fallbacks

## Purpose
Automatically detect user's system capabilities to optimize dependency selection and build configuration.

---

## Detection Commands

### Primary Detection Sequence
Run these commands automatically (no user interaction needed):

```bash
# Node.js and npm versions
node --version
npm --version

# System memory (varies by OS)
# macOS
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Memory:"
# Linux  
free -h | grep "Mem:"
# Windows (if applicable)
wmic OS get TotalVisibleMemorySize /value

# Operating system
uname -a

# CPU info
# macOS
sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
# Linux
lscpu | grep "Model name"

# Available disk space
df -h

# Git availability
git --version

# Check internet connectivity
ping -c 1 google.com
```

## Response Templates

### Successful Detection
```
‚úÖ System Check Complete!

Your Setup:
‚Ä¢ Node.js: v18.17.0 (Excellent - supports latest libraries!)
‚Ä¢ RAM: 16GB (High-end - can use premium dependencies)
‚Ä¢ OS: macOS 14.1 (Fully compatible)
‚Ä¢ CPU: M2 Pro (Lightning fast builds!)
‚Ä¢ Storage: 120GB free (Plenty of space)
‚Ä¢ Git: v2.39.0 (Ready for deployment)

Perfect! I can build you something amazing with these capabilities.

Now let me ask a few questions to make sure I create exactly what you want...
```

### Partial Detection (Some Commands Failed)
```
üîç System Check Complete!

Your Setup:
‚Ä¢ Node.js: v16.8.0 (Great - fully compatible)
‚Ä¢ RAM: 8GB (Perfect for React apps)
‚Ä¢ OS: Windows 10 (Fully supported)
‚Ä¢ Git: Available ‚úÖ

I'll optimize everything for your system to ensure smooth performance.

Now let me ask a few questions to make sure I create exactly what you want...
```

### Detection Failed (Need Manual Input)
```
üîç System Check (Need Your Help!)

I couldn't detect some system info automatically. Quick questions:

What's your Node.js version? 
(Type: node --version in your terminal)

If that doesn't work, no problem - I'll set everything up to work on most systems!

Once I know your setup, I'll ask about your app to build exactly what you want...
```

## Processing Logic

### Step 4a: Run Detection Commands
```python
def detect_system():
    results = {}
    
    # Node.js version
    try:
        node_version = run_command("node --version")
        results['node'] = parse_node_version(node_version)
        results['node_tier'] = get_compatibility_tier(results['node'])
    except:
        results['node'] = None
    
    # Memory
    try:
        if system == "Darwin":  # macOS
            memory = run_command("system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'Memory:'")
        elif system == "Linux":
            memory = run_command("free -h | grep 'Mem:'")
        results['memory'] = parse_memory(memory)
        results['memory_tier'] = get_memory_tier(results['memory'])
    except:
        results['memory'] = None
    
    # Continue for all other detection...
    
    return results
```

### Step 4b: Determine System Tier
```python
def get_system_tier(results):
    if (results.get('node_tier') == 'modern' and 
        results.get('memory_tier') == 'high' and
        results.get('cpu_tier') == 'fast'):
        return 'high_end'
    elif (results.get('node_tier') == 'compatible' and
          results.get('memory_tier') == 'medium'):
        return 'mid_range'
    else:
        return 'budget_friendly'
```

## System Tiers and Implications

### High-End System
- **Node:** 18+ 
- **RAM:** 16GB+
- **CPU:** Modern (M1/M2, i7/i9, Ryzen 7+)
- **Can Use:** Premium animations, advanced state management, heavy dependencies
- **Build Time:** Fast (15-30 seconds)

### Mid-Range System  
- **Node:** 16+
- **RAM:** 8-16GB  
- **CPU:** Standard
- **Can Use:** Balanced libraries, standard features
- **Build Time:** Medium (30-60 seconds)

### Budget-Friendly System
- **Node:** 14+
- **RAM:** 4-8GB
- **CPU:** Older/slower
- **Can Use:** Lightweight libraries, essential features only
- **Build Time:** Slower (1-2 minutes)

## Fallback Handling

### If Node Detection Fails:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Couldn't find Node.js automatically.

No worries! Let's check:
Type this in your terminal: node --version

What do you see?
- A version number (like v18.17.0) ‚Üí Great!
- "command not found" ‚Üí I'll help you install Node.js first
- Something else ‚Üí Just tell me what you see

Don't worry - I'll get everything working!
```

### If Most Detection Fails:
```
üîç Having trouble detecting your system automatically.

No problem! I'll build your app to work on most computers. This might mean:
- Slightly larger file sizes (but still fast)
- Compatibility with older systems too
- Rock-solid reliability

Ready to talk about your app? Let's make something awesome!

## Data Storage & Documentation

### Store Detection Results:
```python
system_config = {
    "node_version": "18.17.0",
    "node_tier": "modern",
    "memory_gb": 16,
    "memory_tier": "high",
    "os": "macOS 14.1",
    "cpu": "M2 Pro", 
    "system_tier": "high_end",
    "git_available": True,
    "detection_success": True,
    "fallback_needed": False
}
```

### Documentation Creation (Step 4)
**MANDATORY**: Create system analysis documentation:

```bash
# Copy and initialize system analysis template
cp instructions/templates/documentation/02_system_analysis_template.md \
   generated_apps/[app-name]/_agent_session/02_system_analysis.md
```

**Fill in the template with:**
- Complete system detection results
- Tier classification reasoning (high_end/mid_range/budget_friendly)
- Technology selection rationale based on system capabilities
- Performance optimization decisions
- Fallback strategies used (if any)
- Timestamp of detection process

This creates a complete record of how the system was optimized for the user's specific environment.

### Use for Dependency Selection:
- High-end ‚Üí framer-motion, zustand, premium libraries
- Mid-range ‚Üí react-transition-group, context API, balanced libraries  
- Budget ‚Üí CSS animations, built-in React state, minimal dependencies

---

## Error Prevention

### Common Issues:
1. **Permission errors** ‚Üí Use non-privileged commands only
2. **Different OS commands** ‚Üí Have fallbacks for each OS
3. **Command not found** ‚Üí Graceful failure with manual fallback
4. **Network timeouts** ‚Üí Don't require internet for core detection

### Robustness:
- Never fail the entire flow due to detection issues
- Always have manual fallback options
- Default to compatible settings when uncertain

---

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ System capabilities accurately detected (or gracefully handled)
‚úÖ User sees their system recognized and optimized for
‚úÖ Dependency selection tier determined
‚úÖ Smooth transition to questioning phase
‚úÖ No technical errors that break the flow
‚úÖ Fallbacks work when detection fails
