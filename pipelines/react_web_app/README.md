# React Web App Pipeline

## Overview
This pipeline automates the creation of React web applications through a structured, conversational process with Claude/Cursor.

## Pipeline Status: ðŸš§ Under Construction
- **Automation Level:** Targeting 75% automation
- **Complexity:** Low-Medium
- **Current Phase:** Initial Development

---

## How It Works

### 1. Trigger Phase
User creates a markdown file: `create_react_app.md` with their app idea.

**Example trigger file:**
```markdown
# Create React App

## App Name
TaskMaster Pro

## Description
A task management app with categories, due dates, and priority levels.

## Key Features
- User authentication
- Task CRUD operations  
- Category management
- Due date notifications
- Priority sorting

## Design Preference
Modern, minimal, dark mode support
```

### 2. Analysis & Questions Phase
System analyzes the request and asks clarifying questions:

**Questions Template:**
- Technical Requirements
  - State management preference? (Context API, Redux, Zustand)
  - Routing needs? (React Router, pages)
  - Styling approach? (CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind)
  - API/Backend? (Mock data, REST, GraphQL)
  
- Functional Requirements
  - User roles/permissions?
  - Data persistence approach?
  - Real-time features needed?
  - Mobile responsive required?

### 3. Specification Generation
Creates `app_specification.md` with complete requirements:

```markdown
# App Specification: [App Name]

## Technical Stack
- React 18+
- Vite
- React Router v6
- [State Management]
- [Styling Solution]

## Component Architecture
[Component tree and relationships]

## Data Models
[Shape of data structures]

## API Endpoints (if applicable)
[List of required endpoints]

## File Structure
[Planned directory organization]
```

### 4. Code Generation Phase

#### Step 4.1: Project Initialization
```bash
npm create vite@latest app-name -- --template react
cd app-name
npm install
```

#### Step 4.2: Install Dependencies
Based on specifications, install required packages

#### Step 4.3: Generate Components
Create components following this structure:
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â””â”€â”€ styles/
```

#### Step 4.4: Implement Business Logic
- Set up routing
- Implement state management
- Create data services
- Add error handling

### 5. Validation Phase
- Run development server
- Execute linting
- Run tests (if configured)
- Generate completion report

## Templates

### Base React App Template
Located in: `templates/base-react-app/`

**Includes:**
- Vite configuration
- ESLint setup
- Basic folder structure
- Common utilities
- Error boundary component
- Loading states

### Component Templates
Located in: `templates/components/`

- Functional component with hooks
- Component with state management
- Form component
- List component with pagination
- Protected route component

---

## Prompts Library

### Effective Prompts for React Generation

**Component Generation:**
```
Create a React functional component called [ComponentName] that:
- Accepts props: [list props with types]
- Manages state for: [state requirements]
- Includes error handling for: [potential errors]
- Returns JSX that: [describe UI]
```

**State Management Setup:**
```
Set up [Redux/Context/Zustand] for managing:
- Global state shape: [describe structure]
- Actions needed: [list actions]
- Async operations: [API calls needed]
```

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Generation
- [ ] App idea is clear and scoped
- [ ] Technical requirements defined
- [ ] Dependencies list created
- [ ] Component architecture planned

### Post-Generation
- [ ] Project runs without errors
- [ ] All routes accessible
- [ ] Components render correctly
- [ ] State management working
- [ ] Styling applied consistently
- [ ] Build completes successfully

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Code follows React best practices
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design implemented
- [ ] Accessibility basics covered
- [ ] Performance acceptable (no obvious issues)

## Common Patterns

### Authentication Flow
```jsx
// Standard auth pattern used across apps
const AuthContext = createContext();
const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
// [Full implementation in templates/patterns/auth.js]
```

### API Service Layer
```javascript
// Consistent API handling
class ApiService {
  // Standard CRUD operations
  // Error handling
  // Token management
}
// [Full implementation in templates/patterns/api-service.js]
```

### Form Handling
```jsx
// Reusable form logic
const useForm = (initialValues, validationRules) => {
  // Validation
  // Submission
  // Error handling
}
// [Full implementation in templates/patterns/form-hook.js]
```

## Limitations & Manual Interventions

### Current Limitations (25% manual work):
1. **Complex Business Logic** - Unique algorithms need human design
2. **Custom Animations** - Sophisticated animations require manual tuning
3. **Third-party Integrations** - API keys, OAuth setup
4. **Performance Optimization** - Code splitting, lazy loading decisions
5. **Design Decisions** - Color schemes, spacing, typography fine-tuning

### When Human Intervention Required:
- Security-critical code sections
- Payment processing integration
- Complex state synchronization
- Custom webpack/build configurations
- Production deployment setup

## Success Metrics

Track these to improve the pipeline:

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Generation Success Rate | 75% | TBD |
| Time to Working App | < 30 min | TBD |
| Manual Fixes Required | < 5 | TBD |
| User Satisfaction | > 4/5 | TBD |

## Improvement Ideas (Backlog)

1. Add TypeScript variant
2. Include testing setup (Jest, React Testing Library)
3. Add more styling options (Material-UI, Chakra)
4. Create deployment templates (Vercel, Netlify)
5. Build component marketplace
6. Add AI-powered code review step
