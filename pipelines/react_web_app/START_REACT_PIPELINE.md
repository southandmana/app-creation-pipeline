## 🎯 MANDATORY EXECUTION SEQUENCE

### STEP 1: INITIATE PROCESS ✅ VALIDATION GATE

🛑 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**
□ Update TodoWrite: "Execute Step 1: Present welcome message and app type options" = in_progress
□ Read file: `instructions/prompts/01_initiate_trigger.md` (REQUIRED)
□ Use EXACT welcome message template below (no variations allowed)
□ Present ALL 5 app categories with emojis and examples as shown
□ Include "Or describe your own idea!" option
□ Wait for user response (DO NOT proceed to Step 2 until user responds)
□ Update TodoWrite: Mark Step 1 as completed when user responds

**MANDATORY MESSAGE TEMPLATE:**
```
Welcome! I'll help you create a React web app. 

What type of app would you like to create? Here are some examples:
1. 📝 Task Management App (todos, projects, deadlines)
2. 🎮 Game App (puzzle, card game, board game)
3. 📊 Dashboard App (analytics, data visualization)
4. 🛍️ E-commerce App (product catalog, shopping cart)
5. 💬 Social App (chat, forum, blog)

Or describe your own idea!
```

🚨 **VALIDATION REQUIREMENT:** Your response MUST match this template exactly.

**Next:** User responds → IMMEDIATELY proceed to Step 2 validation gate.

---

### STEP 2: PROCESS APP TYPE ✅ VALIDATION GATE

🛑 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**
□ Update TodoWrite: "Execute Step 2: Process app type" = in_progress  
□ Read file: `instructions/prompts/02_app_type_processing.md` (REQUIRED)
□ Identify user's app category (game, task, dashboard, ecommerce, social)
□ Use category-specific response template from instruction file
□ Include phrase "Don't worry about technical details - I'll handle all the coding complexity"
□ Request detailed description with category-specific guiding questions
□ Set encouraging, non-technical tone
□ Wait for user's detailed description (DO NOT proceed to Step 3 until received)
□ Update TodoWrite: Mark Step 2 as completed when user provides description

🚨 **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Must use category-specific templates from `02_app_type_processing.md`

**Next:** User provides detailed description → IMMEDIATELY proceed to Step 3 validation gate.

---

### STEP 3: COLLECT DETAILED DESCRIPTION ✅ VALIDATION GATE

🛑 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**
□ Update TodoWrite: "Execute Step 3: Collect detailed description" = in_progress
□ Read file: `instructions/prompts/03_detailed_description.md` (REQUIRED)  
□ Use EXACT response template below (no deviations allowed)
□ Do NOT ask any clarifying questions (that is Step 5 - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN HERE)
□ Acknowledge user input positively
□ Transition to system detection message
□ Update TodoWrite: Mark Step 3 as completed
□ IMMEDIATELY proceed to Step 4 (no delays or other actions)

**MANDATORY RESPONSE TEMPLATE:**
```
Thanks for those details! I can already picture what you want to build - this is going to be awesome!

🔍 Let me quickly check your computer setup to make sure I build this optimally for your system...
```

🚨 **CRITICAL VIOLATION PREVENTION:** If you ask clarifying questions here, you are VIOLATING the pipeline. Questions belong ONLY in Step 5.

**Next:** IMMEDIATELY proceed to Step 4 validation gate (no user input needed).

---

### STEP 4: SYSTEM DETECTION WITH FALLBACKS
Follow instructions in: `instructions/prompts/04_system_detection.md`

**Purpose:** Automatically detect system capabilities for optimization
**Commands to Run:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Memory:" # macOS
free -h | grep "Mem:" # Linux
uname -a
df -h
git --version
```

**System Tiers:**
- **High-End:** Node 18+, 16GB+ RAM, M1/M2/i7+ → Premium libraries
- **Mid-Range:** Node 16+, 8-16GB RAM → Balanced approach  
- **Budget:** Node 14+, 4-8GB RAM → Lightweight alternatives

**Fallback:** If detection fails, ask user for basic system info
**Next:** System detected, proceed to Step 5.

---

### STEP 5: STRUCTURED QUESTIONING (ITERATIVE) ⚠️ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT ZONE

🛑 **ABSOLUTE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED - THIS STEP IS NEVER SKIPPED**

🚨 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**
□ Update TodoWrite: "Execute Step 5: Ask structured questions" = in_progress
□ Read file: `instructions/prompts/05_question_engine.md` (ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED)
□ Initialize question counter (currentQuestion = 1, totalEstimated = ~6)
□ Ask EXACTLY ONE QUESTION using mandatory format below
□ Include progress indicator "Question X of ~6"  
□ Wait for user response (NEVER ask multiple questions)
□ After user response, IMMEDIATELY go to Step 6 for evaluation
□ DO NOT proceed to Step 7 until Step 6 completeness evaluation passes

**MANDATORY QUESTION FORMAT:**
```
📋 Understanding Your Idea (Question [X] of ~6)

[SINGLE QUESTION HERE]
```

**ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS SEQUENCE (Ask in order, one at a time):**
1. "Should this work on phones and tablets too, or just computers?"
2. "Want to put this online so friends can access it from anywhere?"  
3. [Category-specific core feature question from instruction file]
4. "For the look and feel, would you prefer: [style options]"
5. "Should this remember information when you close and reopen it?"

🚨 **CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES:**
- ⛔ NEVER ask more than one question at a time
- ⛔ NEVER skip Step 6 evaluation after each answer
- ⛔ NEVER proceed directly to Step 7 from here
- ⛔ NEVER combine questions or rush the process

**Next:** User answers → MANDATORY Step 6 evaluation (NOT Step 7, NOT specification)

---

### STEP 6: COMPLETENESS EVALUATION (LOOP CONTROL) 🎯 NEVER SKIP THIS STEP

🛑 **MANDATORY EXECUTION AFTER EACH QUESTION:**

🚨 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**
□ Update TodoWrite: "Execute Step 6: Completeness evaluation" = in_progress
□ Read file: `instructions/prompts/07_completeness_evaluation.md` (ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED)
□ Evaluate completeness score using framework below
□ Check for critical gaps in requirements
□ Make go/no-go decision based on 85% threshold
□ Update question counter if continuing
□ Update TodoWrite with evaluation result

**MANDATORY EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:**
1. **Functional Requirements Coverage**: Do we know what the app does? (0-100%)
2. **Technical Specifications**: Are technical needs clear? (0-100%)  
3. **User Experience Definition**: Is the user journey defined? (0-100%)
4. **Performance Requirements**: Are performance expectations set? (0-100%)
5. **Security Considerations**: Are security needs identified? (0-100%)

**DECISION LOGIC (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):**
```
Calculate completenessScore = average of all categories

IF (completenessScore >= 85% AND criticalGaps = 0):
  → UPDATE TodoWrite: Mark Step 6 completed  
  → PROCEED TO Step 7 (Web Research)
  
ELSE IF (currentQuestionRound < 4):
  → CONTINUE_QUESTIONING: Return to Step 5 with next question
  → Update TodoWrite: "Continue questioning - Round [X]"
  
ELSE:
  → PROCEED_WITH_DEFAULTS: Go to Step 7 with warning message
```

🚨 **CRITICAL RULES:**
- ⛔ This evaluation MUST happen after every single question in Step 5
- ⛔ Never skip this step to jump directly to Step 7  
- ⛔ Must achieve 85% completeness OR max 4 rounds before proceeding
- ⛔ Must document the evaluation decision in TodoWrite

**Next:** EITHER return to Step 5 for more questions OR proceed to Step 7 research

---

### STEP 7: WEB RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY SELECTION ✅ VALIDATION GATE

🛑 **MANDATORY PRE-EXECUTION CHECKLIST:**
□ Update TodoWrite: "Execute Step 7: Web research and technology selection" = in_progress
□ Read file: `instructions/prompts/06_web_research_integration.md` (REQUIRED)
□ Display EXACT user experience message below first
□ Conduct ALL 4 research phases using WebSearch tool

---

---

## 🚨 COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY

### **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR 100% COMPLIANCE:**

1. **State Tracking**: EVERY step must be tracked in TodoWrite before/during/after execution
2. **Sequential Execution**: Steps 1→2→3→4→5⟷6→7→8→9→10→11 (no skipping allowed)
3. **Instruction File Reading**: Each step requires reading its designated instruction file
4. **Template Compliance**: Use exact templates - no variations or improvements allowed
5. **Validation Gates**: Complete ALL checklist items before proceeding to next step

### **MOST CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT ZONES:**

⚠️ **STEP 5-6 LOOP**: The question/evaluation loop is THE MOST CRITICAL part of the pipeline
- Step 5: ONE question at a time with progress indicators
- Step 6: MANDATORY evaluation after each question (85% threshold)
- Loop until complete or max 4 rounds

⚠️ **NO SHORTCUTS**: Cannot skip steps, combine steps, or rush through sequences

⚠️ **TODO TRACKING**: TodoWrite must be updated at every major checkpoint

### **VIOLATION DETECTION TRIGGERS:**

🛑 If you find yourself:
- Asking multiple questions at once → STOP, return to Step 5 protocol
- Skipping Step 6 evaluation → STOP, run evaluation immediately  
- Not using TodoWrite → STOP, update state tracking
- Deviating from templates → STOP, use exact template specified
- Combining steps → STOP, execute steps individually

### **ENFORCEMENT GUARANTEE:**

This system provides **SYSTEMATIC CHECKPOINTS** that make it nearly impossible to deviate from the pipeline sequence. Each validation gate must be satisfied before proceeding.
