# Big Tech Product Development Frameworks

## Research Methodology Applied
**4-Phase Research Strategy** from `actionable_systems/research_methodology.md`:
- Phase 1: Landscape Discovery - What frameworks exist in big tech?
- Phase 2: Specific Examples - How do Google, Amazon, Apple implement these?
- Phase 3: Standards & Frameworks - What are the established patterns?
- Phase 4: Current Trends - What's the state of the art in 2025?

## Universal Patterns Identified

### **Cross-Company Consensus:**
All major tech companies share these common elements:
- **Customer-Centric Starting Point:** Begin with customer needs/experience
- **Iterative Development:** Build, test, learn, iterate cycles
- **Data-Driven Validation:** Use metrics and user feedback to guide decisions
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Product, design, engineering, data teams work together
- **Risk Mitigation:** Multiple validation points before major investment
- **Time-Boxed Processes:** Structured timelines to maintain momentum

## Company-Specific Methodologies

### **Google: Data-Driven Engineering Approach**

**Primary Frameworks:**
- **Design Sprint (5-day process)**
- **OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)**
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**

**Google Design Sprint Process:**
```
Day 1 (Monday): Map & Define
- Define key questions and long-term goals
- Create simple product/service map
- Expert knowledge sharing
- Pick target focus area

Day 2 (Tuesday): Sketch Solutions
- Individual detailed solution sketching
- 4-step critical thinking process
- Begin customer testing recruitment

Day 3 (Wednesday): Decide
- Critique all solutions
- Select best concepts
- Create detailed storyboard
- Plan prototype structure

Day 4 (Thursday): Prototype
- Build realistic prototype
- Focus on testing-ready fidelity
- Prepare testing materials

Day 5 (Friday): Test
- Customer interviews
- Observe reactions to prototype
- Learn and validate assumptions
- Define next steps
```

**Internal Google Variation (6-Phase):**
1. **Understand:** Problem unpacking, HMW exercises, user interviews
2. **Define:** User journey mapping, design principles, success metrics
3. **Sketch:** Individual solution ideation
4. **Decide:** Solution selection and prioritization
5. **Prototype:** Build testable version
6. **Validate:** User testing and learning

**Key Principles:**
- 7 people or fewer for optimal team size
- Compress months of debate into 5 days
- Get customer data before expensive commitments
- Emphasize critical thinking over artistry

### **Amazon: Customer-Obsessed Working Backwards**

**Primary Framework:**
- **Working Backwards Methodology**
- **PR/FAQ Process**
- **Think It, Build It, Ship It, Tweak It**

**Working Backwards Process:**
```
Step 1: Write Press Release
- Imagine product is ready to ship
- Write customer-focused announcement
- Focus on customer reaction/value
- Keep to 1 page maximum

Step 2: Create FAQ Document
- Internal stakeholder questions
- External customer questions
- Technical implementation details
- Business model considerations
- Keep to 5 pages maximum

Step 3: Narrative Review Meeting
- 20 minutes silent reading
- Stakeholder discussion period
- Feedback and iteration
- Go/No-go decision

Step 4: Iterative Refinement
- Revise based on feedback
- Re-review if needed
- Most ideas don't proceed (feature, not bug)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Customer focus from day one
- Early validation with minimal resources
- Strategic alignment throughout development
- Systematic idea vetting process

### **Apple: Vision-Driven Liberal Arts Approach**

**Primary Framework:**
- **Apple New Product Process (ANPP)**
- **Stage-Gate Methodology**
- **Executive Review Process**

**Apple's Approach:**
```
ANPP Stages:
- Detailed stage definitions
- Clear responsibility assignments
- Specific deliverables per stage
- Timeline expectations
- Quality standards

Executive Review:
- Weekly Monday meetings
- Every product in development reviewed
- Concentrated resources on few projects
- High-level strategic oversight
```

**Stage-Gate Implementation:**
1. **Discover:** Initial idea exploration
2. **Scoping:** Market and technical assessment
3. **Define Business Case:** Detailed planning and justification
4. **Development:** Product creation phase
5. **Testing & Validation:** Quality assurance and user testing
6. **Launch:** Market introduction and rollout

**Gate Decisions:**
- **Go:** Proceed to next stage
- **Kill:** End project
- **Hold:** Pause for specific reasons
- **Recycle:** Revise and re-review
- **Conditional Go:** Proceed with conditions

## Application to Micro SaaS Development

### **Adapted Framework Recommendations:**
1. **Start with Working Backwards:** Write press release for micro SaaS
2. **Use Modified Design Sprint:** 3-day condensed version for rapid validation
3. **Implement OKRs:** Clear objectives and measurable results
4. **Apply Stage-Gate:** Validation checkpoints throughout development
5. **Focus on Customer Experience:** Begin with user needs, not features

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**
- Multiple validation points
- Early customer feedback
- Data-driven decision making
- Time-boxed development cycles
- Clear success metrics

This research reveals that successful product development is not about choosing one methodology, but about systematically applying customer-centric, data-driven, and iteratively validated approaches that big tech companies have refined over decades of building successful products.
