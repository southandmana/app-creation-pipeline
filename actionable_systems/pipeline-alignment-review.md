# Pipeline Alignment Review Process

## Purpose
Review any created pipeline to ensure it aligns with the master goal of building a user-friendly, non-coder friendly app creation system.

## Review Steps

### 1. Pipeline Functionality Check
- **What does this pipeline do?**
- **What type of apps can it create?**
- **How complex are the apps it can handle?**

### 2. User-Friendliness Assessment
- **Can a non-technical person use this pipeline?**
- **Is the interface simple and intuitive?**
- **Are there clear instructions or guidance?**

### 3. No-Code Requirement Check
- **Does the user need to write any code?**
- **Are all technical aspects automated?**
- **Can someone with zero programming knowledge succeed?**

### 4. Big Tech Standards Alignment
- **Does this follow proven industry practices?**
- **Is it built with scalability and reliability in mind?**
- **Would this meet the standards of successful tech companies?**

### 5. Master Goal Alignment Score
Rate each area (1-5 scale):
- [ ] Universal app creation capability
- [ ] User-friendly interface
- [ ] No coding required
- [ ] Big tech methodology implementation

### 6. Action Items
