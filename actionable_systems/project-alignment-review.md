# Project Alignment Review Process

## Purpose
Review the entire app creation project to ensure it stays aligned with the master goal of building a user-friendly, non-coder friendly system for creating any type of app.

## Overall Project Assessment

### 1. System Completeness Check
- **What can the current system create?**
- **What types of apps are covered?**
- **What complexity levels can it handle?**
- **What gaps still exist?**

### 2. User Experience Evaluation
- **How easy is it for a non-technical person to use the entire system?**
- **Are all components user-friendly?**
- **Is the workflow intuitive from start to finish?**
- **Where do users get confused or stuck?**

### 3. No-Code Implementation Review
- **Can someone create a complete app without any coding?**
- **Are all technical processes automated?**
- **What manual technical steps still exist?**

### 4. Big Tech Standards Assessment
- **Does the overall architecture follow industry best practices?**
- **Is the system scalable and maintainable?**
- **Would this approach be used by successful tech companies?**

### 5. Project Components Alignment
