# System Development Log

## Purpose
Master log tracking the overall app creator system development. Individual pipeline logs track specific pipeline details.

---

## Logging Structure

```
app_creator_1/
├── system_development_log.md (THIS FILE - Overall system decisions)
├── lessons_learned.md (Cross-pipeline insights)
└── pipelines/
    ├── react_web_app/
    │   └── development_log.md (React pipeline specific)
    ├── cli_tools/
    │   └── development_log.md (CLI pipeline specific)
    └── rest_api/
        └── development_log.md (API pipeline specific)
```

Each pipeline has its own `development_log.md` that tracks:
- Design decisions for that pipeline
- Testing results for that pipeline
- Bugs and fixes specific to that app type
- Time tracking for that pipeline's development

This master log tracks:
- Overall system architecture decisions
- Cross-pipeline patterns
- Shared components development
- System-wide improvements

---

## System Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Separate Logs Per Pipeline
**Date:** Current session
**Why:** Better testing isolation, clearer tracking, easier debugging
**Impact:** Each pipeline can be developed/tested independently

### Decision: Start with React Pipeline
**Date:** Current session  
**Why:** 75% automation possible, mature ecosystem
**Impact:** Sets patterns for other pipelines to follow

---

## Pipeline Development Order

1. ✅ React Web Apps (In Progress)
2. ⏳ CLI Tools (Next)
3. ⏳ REST APIs
4. ⏳ Chrome Extensions
5. ⏳ Discord Bots

---

## Shared Components Development

### Components Needed Across All Pipelines:

1. **Question Engine**
   - Asks clarifying questions
   - Stores responses
   - Generates specifications

2. **Trigger System**
   - Reads markdown trigger files
   - Initiates pipeline

3. **Validation System**
   - Runs tests
   - Checks for errors
   - Reports results

4. **Template Engine**
   - Loads templates
   - Replaces variables
   - Generates code

---

## System-Wide Patterns

### Pattern 1: Markdown Triggers
All pipelines use markdown files to trigger creation:
- `create_react_app.md`
- `create_cli_tool.md`
- `create_rest_api.md`

### Pattern 2: Three-Phase Process
All pipelines follow:
1. Analysis & Questions
2. Generation
3. Validation

### Pattern 3: Progressive Enhancement
Start with MVP, then add features iteratively

---

## Cross-Pipeline Discoveries

### What Works Everywhere:
- [To be discovered as we build multiple pipelines]

### What's Pipeline-Specific:
- [To be documented as differences emerge]

## System Performance Metrics

| Pipeline | Dev Time | Success Rate | Avg Generation Time |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| React    | [TBD]    | [TBD]        | [TBD]              |
| CLI      | [TBD]    | [TBD]        | [TBD]              |
| REST API | [TBD]    | [TBD]        | [TBD]              |

---

## Future System Improvements

### Planned:
- [ ] Unified testing framework
- [ ] Pipeline selection wizard
- [ ] Auto-detection of app type
- [ ] Context management system

### Ideas:
- Pipeline mixing (e.g., React + REST API)
- Deployment automation
- Version control integration

## Important Realizations

1. **Each pipeline needs its own log** - Better isolation and testing
2. [More to be added as system develops]
